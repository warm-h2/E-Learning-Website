💡 Highlights of the Project:
1️⃣ Internet Gateway: To provide internet access for resources in the VPC.
2️⃣ Subnets: Separate public and private subnets for better security and resource segregation.
3️⃣ Route Table: To control traffic routing within the VPC.
4️⃣ Route Table Association: Linking subnets to their appropriate route tables.
5 VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 🌐


🛠 Tools Used:
1  Terraform: For Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
2  AWS: As the cloud provider.
3  GitHub: To version-control Terraform code.
4  Visual Studio Code: For writing and managing Terraform files.
5  AWS CLI: For initial configurations.
6  This project leveraged Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure automation, consistency, and ease of scaling. 📈
7  Step-by-Step Guide:

**Set Up Your Environment** 🌍

-  Install Terraform on your local machine
-  Configure AWS credentials for Terraform access.
-  Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 🌐
-  Define a new VPC to host our resources, ensuring a secure and isolated network.
-  Set Up Internet Gateway 🌉
-  Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC to allow communication between resources in the VPC and the internet.
-  Create Subnets 🏗️
-  Public Subnet: For resources that need direct access to the internet (e.g., web servers).
-  Private Subnet: For backend resources (e.g., databases) that do not require direct internet access.
-  Configure Route Tables 📊
-  Set up route tables to control traffic flow within the VPC:
-  Associate the public subnet with a route table that directs traffic to the Internet Gateway.
-  Ensure the private subnet has a route table that manages internal communication.

**Set Up Security Groups 🔒**
-  Create security groups to define inbound and outbound traffic rules:
-  Allow HTTP and HTTPS access for the web servers.
-  Enable SSH access for admin purposes.

**Deploy EC2 Instances 💻**
-  Launch EC2 instances in the public subnet for the web application
-  Optionally, deploy instances in the private subnet for the database.

**Deploy Application Code 📦**
-  Use user data scripts to automate the deployment of your E-learning application on the EC2 instances.
